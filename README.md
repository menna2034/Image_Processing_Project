# Simple Perception Stack for Self-Driving Cars

In this project we are going to create a simple perception stack for self-driving cars (SDCs.),we’re going to be focusing on video streams from cameras. We’re mainly going to be analyzing the road ahead, detecting the lane lines, detecting other 
cars/agents on the road, and estimating some useful information such as estimation of the the vehicle position away from the center of the 
lane and the radius of curvature of the road as well.
